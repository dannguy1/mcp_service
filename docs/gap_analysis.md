# MCP Codebase Gap Analysis

This document analyzes the current codebase of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) project against the architectural goals and requirements. It identifies missing, incomplete, or misaligned features and provides recommendations for addressing each gap.

---

## 1. Protocol Definition & Agent Interoperability

**Goal:**  
Standardize agent interaction with logs and models via a clear protocol (interfaces, data contracts).

**Current State:**  
- Some agent base classes exist, but the protocol (interfaces, contracts) is not fully documented or enforced.
- Lack of clear, versioned protocol documentation for agent developers.
- Data contracts for logs, features, and anomalies are not always explicit or validated.

**Gaps:**  
- No formal MCP protocol definition (e.g., Python ABCs, Pydantic models, or OpenAPI docs).
- No developer documentation for implementing new agents.

**Recommendations:**  
- Define and document MCP agent interfaces (e.g., `BaseAgent` with required methods).
- Use Pydantic models for all data contracts (logs, features, anomalies, exports).
- Provide a protocol reference guide for agent developers.

---

## 2. Agent Plug-and-Play Architecture

**Goal:**  
Allow easy integration of new domain-specific agents without modifying the core system.

**Current State:**  
- Agents are implemented as Python classes, but dynamic discovery/registration is limited.
- No plugin/registration mechanism for agents.

**Gaps:**  
- No agent registry or plugin loader.
- Adding new agents may require code changes in the core.

**Recommendations:**  
- Implement an agent registry or plugin loader (e.g., using entry points or dynamic import).
- Document agent packaging and registration process.

---

## 3. Log Extraction & DataService

**Goal:**  
Centralized, efficient access to logs (PostgreSQL), anomalies (SQLite), and cache (Redis).

**Current State:**  
- DataService abstraction exists, but may lack full error handling, connection pooling, and schema abstraction.
- Log extraction logic may be tightly coupled to specific schemas.

**Gaps:**  
- Insufficient abstraction for different log schemas.
- Error handling and connection pooling may be incomplete.
- No support for schema evolution or log source configuration.

**Recommendations:**  
- Refactor DataService for better abstraction and error handling.
- Add configuration for log source schemas.
- Implement connection pooling and retry logic.

---

## 4. Model Loading & Inference

**Goal:**  
Load externally trained models and use them for agent inference.

**Current State:**  
- ModelManager exists, but model loading and versioning may not be robust.
- No clear process for updating/replacing models.

**Gaps:**  
- No model version management or validation.
- No automated model deployment/update process.

**Recommendations:**  
- Implement model versioning and validation.
- Document model deployment/update workflow.

---

## 5. Anomaly Storage & Export

**Goal:**  
Store anomalies locally (SQLite) and export logs/anomalies for external training.

**Current State:**  
- SQLite storage for anomalies is present.
- Export system exists, but may lack flexible filtering, batch processing, and progress tracking.

**Gaps:**  
- Export filtering and format options may be limited.
- No robust export status/progress tracking.
- No export history or audit log.

**Recommendations:**  
- Enhance export system with flexible filters, batch processing, and status tracking.
- Add export history/audit log.

---

## 6. FastAPI Web Server & API

**Goal:**  
REST API for management, export, and health monitoring.

**Current State:**  
- FastAPI server is present.
- Health endpoint exists.
- Export endpoints may be incomplete or lack documentation.

**Gaps:**  
- Incomplete OpenAPI documentation.
- Missing endpoints for agent management, export status, or configuration.

**Recommendations:**  
- Complete and document all API endpoints.
- Ensure OpenAPI schema is accurate and up-to-date.

---

## 7. Notification System

**Goal:**  
Send alerts (email/Slack) for detected anomalies.

**Current State:**  
- Notification logic is present but may be hardcoded or lack configuration.

**Gaps:**  
- No pluggable notification backend.
- No configuration for notification channels.

**Recommendations:**  
- Refactor notification system for pluggability and configuration.

---

## 8. Configuration & Deployment

**Goal:**  
Environment-based configuration, Docker Compose deployment, volume management.

**Current State:**  
- Docker Compose and environment variable usage are present.

**Gaps:**  
- Incomplete documentation for deployment and configuration.
- No automated setup scripts for local development.

**Recommendations:**  
- Expand deployment/configuration documentation.
- Provide setup scripts for developers.

---

## 9. Testing & Validation

**Goal:**  
Unit and integration tests for all core components.

**Current State:**  
- Some tests exist, but coverage is incomplete.

**Gaps:**  
- Missing tests for agent protocol compliance, export, and error handling.
- No integration tests for end-to-end flows.

**Recommendations:**  
- Increase unit and integration test coverage.
- Add protocol compliance and export tests.

---

## 10. Documentation

**Goal:**  
Comprehensive developer and user documentation.

**Current State:**  
- Architecture doc exists.
- API and agent developer docs are limited.

**Gaps:**  
- No protocol reference, agent development guide, or API usage examples.

**Recommendations:**  
- Write protocol reference and agent development guide.
- Add API usage and deployment examples.
