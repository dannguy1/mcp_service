## 1. **Export API Router & Endpoints**

**Plan:**  
- Requires a FastAPI router at `backend/app/api/endpoints/export.py` with endpoints for creating exports, checking status, listing exports, and progress polling.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- No direct evidence of `backend/app/api/endpoints/export.py` or export-related endpoints in the provided file structure or code excerpts.

**Gap:**  
- The export API router and endpoints likely need to be implemented.

---

## 2. **Background Task Processing**

**Plan:**  
- Export jobs should run as FastAPI background tasks for async processing.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- No mention of FastAPI background tasks or async export processing in the backend code excerpts.

**Gap:**  
- Background task integration for export jobs is likely missing.

---

## 3. **Export Status Tracking & Real-time Updates**

**Plan:**  
- Requires an `ExportStatusManager` with real-time progress updates, and endpoints for polling progress.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- No evidence of an `ExportStatusManager` or real-time status endpoints in the backend.

**Gap:**  
- Real-time status tracking and polling endpoints need to be implemented.

---

## 4. **ExportConfig Model Enhancements**

**Plan:**  
- `ExportConfig` should support optional date ranges, flexible filters, and validation.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- No direct evidence of an updated `ExportConfig` model with these features.

**Gap:**  
- The `ExportConfig` model may need to be updated to match the plan.

---

## 5. **DataExporter Enhancements**

**Plan:**  
- `DataExporter` should support batch processing, flexible date ranges, and per-type filtering.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- No code excerpts for `DataExporter` or its methods.

**Gap:**  
- The `DataExporter` class may need enhancements for batch processing, flexible filtering, and progress tracking.

---

## 6. **Frontend Export UI**

**Plan:**  
- Requires React components: `ExportControl`, `ExportStatus`, and export history.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- The frontend structure exists, but no evidence of export-related components in export.

**Gap:**  
- Export UI components likely need to be implemented or completed.

---

## 7. **Testing**

**Plan:**  
- Unit and integration tests for export functionality.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- Test structure exists, but no mention of export-related tests in `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`.

**Gap:**  
- Export-specific tests may be missing.

---

## 8. **Documentation**

**Plan:**  
- API documentation, user guide, and troubleshooting for export.

**Workspace Evidence:**  
- Documentation plan exists, but unclear if API docs and user guides for export are present.

**Gap:**  
- Documentation for export endpoints and usage may need to be written.

---

## 9. **Other Technical Requirements**

- **Async Processing:** No evidence of async export processing.
- **Error Handling:** No evidence of comprehensive error handling for export.
- **Database Transaction Safety:** Not verifiable from current info.

### **Conclusion**

There are significant gaps between the plan and the current codebase, especially around the export API endpoints, background processing, real-time status tracking, frontend UI, and testing. The plan provides a clear roadmap for closing these gaps.

For implementation, start with the backend API router and models, then move to the DataExporter enhancements, status tracking, frontend UI, and finally testing and documentation.
