# Model Loading Implementation Plan

This implementation plan is based on the requirements and workflow described in `Model-Loading-Guide.md`. It is intended to guide an AI coder or developer to implement the model loading, validation, and management features in the MCP system, ensuring the process matches the documentation and is robust, user-friendly, and maintainable.

---

## 1. Model Package Handling

### 1.1. Accepting Model Packages

- **Requirement:**  
  The system must accept model packages as ZIP files, either via the REST API or the frontend UI.  
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Implement a REST API endpoint (`POST /api/v1/model-management/import`) to accept a ZIP file upload.
  2. Ensure the endpoint saves the uploaded file to a temporary directory on the host filesystem.
  3. Validate that the file is a ZIP archive and follows the naming convention (`model_{version}_deployment.zip`).

### 1.2. Manual File Placement

- **Requirement:**  
  Users may also manually copy and extract model packages into the correct directory.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Document the expected directory structure (`backend/models/model_{version}/`).
  2. On MCP service startup or reload, scan this directory for new models and register them.

---

## 2. Model Package Extraction and Validation

### 2.1. Extraction

- **Requirement:**  
  The system must extract the ZIP archive into a versioned subdirectory under `backend/models/`.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. After upload, extract the ZIP to `backend/models/model_{version}/`.
  2. Overwrite any existing directory for the same version or model type.

### 2.2. Content Validation

- **Requirement:**  
  The extracted directory must contain all required files:
    - `model.joblib`
    - `scaler.joblib` (optional)
    - `metadata.json`
    - `deployment_manifest.json`
    - `validate_model.py`
    - `inference_example.py`
    - `requirements.txt`
    - `README.md`
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Check for the presence of all required files.
  2. Parse `deployment_manifest.json` and `metadata.json` for integrity and compatibility.
  3. Verify SHA256 hashes of files as specified in `deployment_manifest.json`.
  4. Optionally, run `validate_model.py` in a subprocess and capture output.
  5. If validation fails, return a clear error to the user (API/UI).

---

## 3. Model Registration and Replacement

### 3.1. Model Registry

- **Requirement:**  
  The system must maintain a registry of available models, their versions, and status.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Implement a registry (e.g., SQLite table or in-memory structure) to track:
      - Model type
      - Version
      - Status (active, validated, failed, etc.)
      - Import and deployment timestamps
  2. On successful import, update the registry.
  3. If a model of the same type exists, replace it and update the registry accordingly.

---

## 4. Model Deployment and Activation

### 4.1. Deployment

- **Requirement:**  
  The user must be able to deploy (activate) a validated model via API or UI.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Implement an endpoint (`POST /api/v1/model-management/{version}/deploy`) to activate a model.
  2. Ensure only one model per type is active at a time.
  3. On deployment, update the registry and reload the model in the inference service.

### 4.2. Rollback

- **Requirement:**  
  The user must be able to rollback to a previous model version.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Implement an endpoint (`POST /api/v1/model-management/{version}/rollback`).
  2. Update the registry and reload the previous model.

---

## 5. Frontend UI Integration

### 5.1. Model Import UI

- **Requirement:**  
  The UI must allow users to select a model ZIP file from the host filesystem, upload it, and display metadata for confirmation.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Implement a file picker and upload button in the Models page.
  2. After upload, display parsed metadata and validation results.
  3. Allow the user to confirm import and trigger deployment/validation.

### 5.2. Model List and Status

- **Requirement:**  
  The UI must display all available models, their status, and allow deployment/rollback/validation actions.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Fetch model list and status from the backend.
  2. Provide action buttons for deploy, rollback, and validate.

---

## 6. API Endpoints

### 6.1. Required Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/model-management/import` — Import model package (ZIP)
- `GET /api/v1/model-management/models` — List all models
- `GET /api/v1/model-management/models/{version}` — Get model info
- `POST /api/v1/model-management/{version}/deploy` — Deploy model version
- `POST /api/v1/model-management/{version}/rollback` — Rollback to previous version
- `POST /api/v1/model-management/{version}/validate` — Validate model

---

## 7. Model Directory Scanning

- On service startup or reload, scan `backend/models/` for all `model_{version}/` directories.
- Validate and register any new models found.

---

## 8. Error Handling and User Feedback

- All errors (validation, extraction, deployment) must be clearly reported via API and UI.
- Provide actionable error messages (e.g., missing file, hash mismatch, validation script failed).

---

## 9. Security and Permissions

- Ensure only authorized users can import, deploy, or rollback models (API and UI).
- Validate file types and paths to prevent directory traversal or malicious uploads.

---

## 10. Documentation and Examples

- Update user and developer documentation to match the implemented workflow.
- Provide example commands and UI screenshots where possible.

# Implementation Notes

- **No automatic scanning/import from training service or external directories.**
- **All model imports must be user-initiated via UI or API, and the model package must be manually copied to the host filesystem first.**
- **If a model of the same type exists, it will be replaced.**
- **Validation and deployment must be explicit and user-driven.**

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate models** before deployment in production.
2. **Keep model versions** for rollback capability.
3. **Monitor performance** after model deployment.
4. **Use descriptive naming** for model directories.
5. **Document model changes** in transfer history.
6. **Test models** on sample data before deployment.
7. **Set up alerts** for model performance issues.
8. **Regular drift monitoring** to detect degradation.
